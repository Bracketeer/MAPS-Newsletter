            <p><b>What motivated you to get on a call with MAPS? Get on a call?</b></p>

            <p>
              Do you mean Mastery Coaching compared to BOLD or group coaching? We know what you focus on expands. I needed help focusing on my new business in real estate. In order to achieve my goals of $250,000 GCI my first 12 months I knew I needed high-level, proven expertise, with the proper credentials. There are SIX reasons for me to go straight into Mastery Coaching my first week as a real esstate agent: Point me toward the field tested MREA models. Shorten my learning curve. Minimize mistakes as a new agent.Guide me to make the best use of my time. Benefit from their experience Hold me accountable to my plan, because you focus on the plan not the problem.

            <p class="cta">
              "Why hire MAPS? My trust in trustworthy people. Mo Anderson, Vice Chairman of Keller Williams, told me herself that BOLD is so effective that she wishes it could be required for every new agent. Gary Keller provides solid proven advice and he suggests BOLD 10 times. My friend Jason Grotelueschen, and six time BOLD graduate, encouraged me to join BOLD. When? My first MAPS BOLD was June of 2015 during real estate school. I signed up for the second one before becoming a licensed agent. I signed up for Mastery Coaching during Mega Camp, which was two days BEFORE my first day as an agent. These services give you a great deal of clarity and clarity is power." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– John Wolf

              <b>Summarize where you're at with your business…</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Since it is illegal to perform the tasks of a realtor without a license, during BOLD I could only call my sphere of influence (a sophisticated term for everyone I know in my iPhone that will happily accept my call) I graduated from my first BOLD this summer, before I became a realtor, holding ‘soft intent’ from my friedns to handle $1.4 million in real estate buisness, netting approximately $38,000 in commissions. Today, I’m starting my 3rd week in real estate and dilligently pursuing those leads while consistently doing my lead-gen each day in addition to daily scripts practice and role play.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What are your business goals?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              The purpose of business is to fund the perfect life. My short term goal is $250,000 GCI my first 12 months in real estate (ending 8/31/16) by utilizing the potent combination of three things in my arsenal to collect my unfair share:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>My experience in BOLD</li>
              <li>Mastery coaching</li>
              <li>The battle-proven MREA field manual.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              My long term goal is open Keller Williama Market Center in the Carribean. I prefer not to disclose which island… suffice it to say I have seven requirements…
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Enough inhabitants/tourists (e.g. demand for real estate) to support a market center</li>
              <li>Bright sun</li>
              <li>Blue skies</li>
              <li>White Sand</li>
              <li>Turquoise water</li>
              <li>Oceanfront property</li>
              <li>English as predominant language</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              <b>What's working well in your business?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Frankly, I feel as though I am sipping from the proverbial fire hydrant. Working well? This interview arrived in the midst of perfecting my out-of-control schedule. All work expands to fill the time allowed. There is SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY that I have created a maelstrom of activity. I haven been calling, conducting open houses, knocking on doors, and asking numerous strangers the famous question: "Do you know of someone that is looking to sell their home, buy a home, or invest in real estate?” Fortunately my Mastery Coach, Sajag Patel, and Keller William Market Center Productivity coach, Matt Holder, are helping me focus on what’s most important: Consistent Lead Generation. My former mentee is now mentoring me and a small group 30 minutes per day, five days per week on scripts and role play. Because its not about selling real estate, its about following a schedule.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What knowledge have you gained from MAPS coaching?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              There’s so much that I’ve learned in such a short period, time and space does not permit me to share it all. Success leaves clues. To simplify it, its like the basics of baseball… throw, catch, hit, run… the basics of real estate sales is found in the five point job description:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Lead Generate</li>
              <li>Lead Follow up</li>
              <li>Go on appointments</li>
              <li>Negotiate contracts</li>
              <li>Scripts and role play</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              <b>What results do you expect?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              MAPS coaching through BOLD and Mastery coachng helps me grow. Your business grows to the extent you do. What results do I expect? To achieve my highest aspirations. To enjoy the freedom created by wealth from following the proven models of success found in the MREA (the Red book). To feel what it’s like to earn $250,000 in 12 months. To bring others along the journey. I’m currently mentoring three other new agents like myself with weekly meeting of MPG (My Peer Group).
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What does success look like to you?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              See results expected. Success looks like, a $100 gift card FROM my housekeeper because I’ve enriched her life She’s paid 25% above average wages, and I Helped her son pursue college degree after a colorful and highly questionable adolescent period.
            </p>

            <p>
              I find myself with my dear coleague Jason (my mentor and former mentee) leading a team of happy enthusiastic high-minded real estate agents both domestic, and abroad, with a strong work/life balance in pursuit of thier own dreams with an unmatchable culture (clarified by Mo Anderson and Kay Evans in 41 examples of culture) that fuels the perpetual processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What breakthroughs have you had already?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              Success is simple, its not easy.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>What would you tell someone who is thinking about hiring MAPS?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              I can give you Why would you not? Don’t listen to your drunk monkey. MAPS coaching is 90% mindset and 10% application. When you chang e your thinking you change your world. If you are willing to apply what you are taught the money will follow. As part of the intial startup budget consider $800 every 2 months for Bold and $1,000 for Mastery Coaching. If you are willing to utilize what you learn, and money is in the way of attending your first BOLD class have a very personal visit with the BOLD coach coming to your area and your team leader.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Who should we thank for your business?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              The credit belongs to the numerous people that have pointed me toward the MAPS coaching, including but not limited to:

                        <p><b>Scott: Brett, why don't you tell us how you got into real estate and your process leading up to hiring MAPS.</b></p>

                        <p>Brett: I got licensed ten years ago and came out of the gates really hot. About two years after that my production wasn't great, and after three years with KW I joined MAPS Coaching. That was really when my business started to take off.</p>

                        <p><b>Scott: Okay. Where was your business specifically at prior to MAPS Coaching?</b></p>

                          <p>Brett: It was probably hovering around a couple hundred units per year.</p>

                          <p><b>Scott: Name something specific that you worked on that really stands out to you with your MAPS Coach that helped you through a plateau that you had to hit.</b></p>

                          <p>Brett: My coach recently asked me what percentage of my business was distressed business, and mine was about 80%. Then he asked me what percent of the market is distressed, and I told him 20%. He told me that it looked like if I didn't change my business that I might not be around in a year. That's a tough thing to hear, but it transitioned my business.</p>

                          <p><b>Scott: That's awesome. How has the coaching affected other parts of your life? Not just business-wise, but personally?</b></p> -->

                          <p class="cta">"My coach spends a lot of time talking about leadership and how I lead my team. This has actually created a lot of balance in my life because my kids are 6, 4, and 2. Being a better leader at work has allowed me to also be a better father because I have more time to spend outside of work."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Brett Tanner</p>
            <!--
                          <p><b>Scott: How do you measure the results for your return on investment (if that's possible) with MAPS?</b></p>

                          <p>Brett: I could have a number of answers to that, but I've made a lot of good decisions for my business with MAPS. I can't exactly put a number on that, but I know that my business wouldn't be where it is today without a maps coach.</p>

                          <p><b>Scott: Looking back to when you hired MAPS Coaching, what fears and concerns did you have at that time when you were making that decision?</b></p>

                          <p>Brett: None, really. I believed in the KW models and their systems, and that's the reason why I went to MAPS.</p>

                          <p><b>Scott: What is the one thing that you like most about working with MAPS coaching?</b></p>

                          <p>Brett: I would say the consistency because it allows me to build a plan, stay on the plan, and not get lost with shiny object syndrome.</p>

                          <p><b>Scott: Awesome. So what would you say to someone who's on the fence about hiring MAPS Coaching and what tips would you offer to them to make sure they get the best results.</b></p>

                          <p>Brett: My advice would be that you need someone out there to make sure that your thought process is right. And if you're on the fence, I'd just say do it. If you want to have a big business you have to do it.</p>

                          <p><b>Scott: Alright. Last question: If you could some up your MAPS Coaching experience with one sentence or one thought, what would it be.</b></p>

                          <p>Brett: They're going to force you to acknowledge your blind spots. They'll push you out of that comfort zone and into that next level of success.</p> -->
